-__Attack Features__-
These are the two swords featured on the left and right of the site. These are the primary means of interacting with the gladiator game, as they allow you to strike your opponent. In the first fight, if the user clicks the correct side a gore sound effect will signify a hit against the gladiator. If a metal clang sound effect is heard, the opponent has blocked the attack. These are made to be as large as possible to make attacking easier and clear for the user.

As previously mentioned, sound effects are utilized to signify hits and blocks to the user. A swing sound effect sounds whenever the user clicks on the swords to demonstrate a sword swing against their opponenet. A loud cheer is played when the user defeats the first gladiator and progresses to the next gladiator. Furthermore, an ambient soundtrack plays in the background to help immerse and engage the user.

A responsive tally that tells you the current hits landed on the gladiator you're facing. They also serve to illustrate if an attack has hit the opponent or not, especially if the user has toggled the mute button. This is to indicate how close the user is to winning the gladiator game. In the second fight, there are two tallies. One for the user (in green) and one for the boss gladiator. Each starts at 0 and when either the player or boss lands a hit, their respective tally will increment until one hits five. First one to hit 5 loses and the other is declared the winner.
